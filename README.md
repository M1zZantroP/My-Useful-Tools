1. **duplicateFileRemover**

This is a cross-platform console program what supports in Linux/Win/MacOS. Its calculates all the hash sum of you files, and if its find a duplicate than ask you for removing them.

P.S. Your files may also have other names. The result is not affected.

2. **Spotihelper**

Tool for improving your Spotify experience. You may add all songs from different singers into your own playlist.

3. **Help-me-layouts**

This script will help correct incorrect text inside the clipboard. All you have to do is copy the incorrect sentence, press a keyboard shortcut to run the script, and paste the correct sentence in the necessary position. __The program works only between EN and UKR layouts__.  
I also generated an executed file so that it could be used on a PC without a Python interpreter installed.  
To use, assign the command _./help-my-layouts_ to a specific hot key. To fix CAPS, assign the command _./help-my-layouts 1_.
